- Heavily rebalanced classes and skills to create distinct classes and suit permadeath
- Full custom quest system

- Custom gachapon and reward system
- Dozens of custom commands

- Custom mount quests
- etc...

This is a repository for the core server files of the server; it does **not** include such things as scripts and XMLs/WZs.

The project is quite centralized â€” however, the code is here for all to see. Anyone may feel free to make a branch/pull request, or even just some personal advice.

This repo is mostly for remote development convenience.
